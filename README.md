# Memory Merge Find

MemoryMergeFind is a package for a Java program that reads two separate JSON/CSV files and merges them into a new
file. It takes user input as search criteria, searching the merged file for the search word, and finding the data
sets containing the search word. Through its interactive design, the program allows the user to search multiple
times, displaying the search word, time of the search, duration of the search, and the number of data sets
retrieved for each search. It also will provide the total amount of searches and the amount of times each search
word was searched for.

The program consists of the MemoryMergeFind.java file which contains the main method, countSearches method
(counts the amount of searches per search word and prints to the system), printSearches method (prints the
information for each specific search), and the public class MemoryMergeFind. No other java files are needed for
the program. The program takes the two JSON/CSV files from the InputFiles folder as file inputs and will
overwrite the file in the OutputFiles folder.
